# Android-App
Use Android Studio to open
Check README for pull instructions
I was able to pull the project in by creating an empty android project
then go to C:/users/you/AndroidStudioProjects/youremptyproject
then delete everything in that folder so that its empty
Open android studio into that empty project folder and sign into github in file.settings.versioncontrol.github
then go to the top of the main view select VCS on the bar
then click create git repository, set the empty project folder as the repository
go to your command prompt and cd to that directory
use git pull "https://github.com/LMCBikeSharing/Android-App.git" to then pull the app
follow any popups that android studio gives you to fix any issues(Android studio usually does a good job of helping you with any 
syntax errors
You should have a working pulled repository
to commit and then push you need to create a remote repository in the command prompt(follow git instructions)

***or if you have already signed into github in android studio, create a new project in the bootup screen using github
then import it with the same address as above.
